<a href="#">PERFECT NUMBERS GUESSING GAME</a> - build simple game to randomly generate a number; determine if it's perfect, abundant, or deficient; receive a guess from up to four players; determine if the guess is correct; and to keep score until one player reaches 10 points and wins the game.

<a href="#">SYMBOL TABLE</a> - build a linked list for a symbol table. allow the user to add, modify, remove, and display information for a single symbol; also allow a 'display all'.
